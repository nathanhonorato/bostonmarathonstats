## Overview

bostonmarathonstats provides an easy way to analyze data of runners that finished the Boston Marathon from 2009 to 2022.

* `boston_summary()` summarises data of an year.
* `boston_position` searches the athletes that finished in a certain position.
* `boston_country` summarises data of a country.
* `boston_athlete` searches results of an athlete.
* `boston_density_ridges()` make a density plot of the amount of runners over the finishing time.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bostonmarathonstats from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nathanhonorato/bostonmarathonstats")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example of one of the functions of this package. `boston_summary` informs the numbers of finishers by gender of a certain year of event.

```{r example}
library(bostonmarathonstats)
boston_summary(gender = "Female", year = 2021)
```

These are the first few rows of the database `results_boston` used in this package called. It has data about the runners such as gender, residence information and finishing time.

```{r cars}
head(results_boston, 5) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

This package also has the function `boston_density_ridges()` to make a density plot of finishing times:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
boston_density_ridges(year = 2012:2019, 
                      range_position = 1:10)
```
